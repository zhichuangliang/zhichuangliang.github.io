# About me
My name is Zhichuang Liang. I am currently working as a senior algorithm engineer in Ant Group. I received my Ph.D. in Cyberspace Security from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn), Fudan University in 2024, during which I was supervised by Prof. [Yunlei Zhao](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/3f/ba/c25909a278458/page.htm). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2019. My research focus is on lattice-based cryptography, privacy computing and applied mathematics.
